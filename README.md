 MultiMedAI is a real-time, doctor-assistive computer vision system designed to support Ayurvedic visual assessment (Darshana) by capturing a standardized and stable facial representation from a live camera feed. The system infers a normalized 3D facial mesh from RGB video, detects and locks a single patient face in multi-person environments, and enforces quality and temporal stability over consecutive frames to ensure neutral pose, expression, distance, and lighting before capturing one trusted snapshot. All facial measurements are derived via controlled 3D-to-2D projection from this verified 3D geometry, rather than from raw images, enabling camera-independent, reproducible facial ratios suitable for longitudinal observation while remaining strictly assistive and non-diagnostic in nature.
